Every worker is neutral about every one of the remaining shifts.

The total amount of constraints here is 88, (21 - At least one per shift, 21 - No more then 2 per shift,
23 - preferences, 23 - no work days).

Also it could be shown that that the minimum amount of unsatisfied constraints is 13.

And in practice the walkSAT satisfies 75.
Meaning that it dissatisfies the least possible constraints.
