            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In workplaces some people might want to work at certain times and not in
                others, many times their wishes cannot be fullfilled but we are determined
                to fullfill as many worker preferences as we can.</p>

            <p>We are (naturally) going to solve this problem using CSP techniques we have
                learned in class.</p>

            <h3>Approach and Method</h3>
                <p> First build a general case CSP solver, and then feed it with specific
                    problems (Specific problems would also entail implementing the supplied
                    interface).
                <h4>Worker shift satisfaction</h4>
                <p> There are a couple of different constraint types.
                    The first are hard constraints, these are constraints that must be satisfied,
                    In our case these are one to two people at each shift. The second is also a hard
                    constraint, That represents the workers rest days. Third is a soft constraints,
                    a constraint that we strive to satisfy but are not obligated to.</p>

                <p>We are going to try and solve this problem using a few algorithms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Backtracking </li>
                    <li> WalkSAT (adjusted to our problem) </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Backtracking </h4>
                    <p> The algorithm is greedy, in the sense that after it satisfies the hard constraints, it will
                        add one by one the soft constraints, if they are satisfied then we keep them otherwise we
                        dispose of them. Although we do this greedily we do use a heuristic, that might try to add them
                        in an order that will insure maximum fullfillment.</p>
                <h4> WalkSAT </h4>
                    <p> All constraints are present from the very begining (not adding one by one like the backtrack).
                        The WalkSAT will attempt to satisfy as many worker preferences as it can.</p>
